    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>1 kg of flour "00"</li>
        <li>600 ml water</li>
        <li>3 gr dried yeast</li>
        <li>15 gr salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Start pouring the flour in a large mixer bowl.</li>
        <li>In small bowl add luke-warm water and then add yeast, mixing gently until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Turn the mixer on with the hook mountend on medium-to-low speed and start pouring the water little by little, making sure you wait for the previous dose to be absorbed by the flour.</li>
        <li>Keep kneading 'til the dough gets smooth and homogeneous. When it gets to that point, keep kneading for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and keep the mixer running until the salt is fully combined with the dough.</li>
        <li>When the salt is fully absorbed, remove the dough from the mixer and knead with your hands until you get a large ball.</li>
        <li>Place it in a large bowl, cover with foil or a clean humid cloth, then let it rise in the oven with the light on.</li>
        <li>Wait until the mixture has at least doubled in volume (after 1.5 h). Ideally, you should let it triple in size (at least 3 hours).</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, transfer it on a work surface.</li> 
        <li>Divide it into 4 equal parts and shape them as balls using your hands. Once done, cover them with a clean cloth and let them stand for 30 minutes at room temperature, before using them to make your pizzas.</li>
